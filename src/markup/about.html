    <p>I am Sandeep. I have just finished college and am looking for a job. I am interested in most entry level technical positions or even internships.</p>
    <p>I know Java, HTML, CSS & JS and am learning React currently. I also have hands on experience with Linux, Git and other dev (cli) tools used in the development process.</p>
